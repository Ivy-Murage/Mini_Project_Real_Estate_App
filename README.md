# Real Estate Mini Project

#### Problem Statement
For students, finding inexpensive housing can be very difficult, especially in urban locations where rents are high, and real estate costs are high. It can be challenging for many students to find an appropriate and cheap location to live since they find it tough to reconcile the cost of living with their educational obligations. 


#### Solution Statement
This is where real estate software tailored exclusively to students' requirements can really help. The app must assist students in quickly and easily locating affordable homes that fit their needs and preferences for location and price. Additionally, the app should give pupils pertinent details about the houses, such as the cost of living, neighborhood conveniences, and the landlord's standing. To simplify the process of locating a place to live as stress-free as possible, the objective is to establish a one-stop shop for students looking for inexpensive accommodation.
